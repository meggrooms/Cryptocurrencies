## Purpose
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. I created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
